            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Norman Yeung, a dedicated software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and engineering. My academic journey began at <span class="highlight">UC Davis</span>, where I studied from 2019 to 2020. During my time there, I developed a solid understanding of core engineering principles and discovered my passion for technology.</p>
            <p>In 2022, I continued my education at <span class="highlight">East Bay</span>, where I further honed my skills and specialized in software development. My coursework included advanced topics in <span class="highlight">data structures</span>, algorithms, and software design. I am set to graduate in 2024, and I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges.</p>
            <p>My experiences at both institutions have equipped me with the technical expertise and problem-solving abilities needed to excel in the field of software engineering. I am always looking forward to learning new technologies and working with a dynamic team to create impactful solutions. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals.</p>
